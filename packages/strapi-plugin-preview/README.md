Requirements</a>.

**Supported Strapi versions**:

- Strapi v3.5.3 (recently tested)

(This plugin may work with the older Strapi versions, but these are not tested
nor officially supported at this time.)

**We recommend always using the latest version of Strapi to start your new
projects**.

## Features

-**Create Clone ** Now you will be able to clone every content type entry

-**Publish Clone ** When entry is clone, it could be published, which will
overwrite original contentType record

-**Preview your entry** With customised preview URI, You can preview your draft
(entry)

## Preview URL customization: Custom.js

in file `/config/custom.js` need to add previewUrl field with two parameters
like below:

```json
{
  "previewUrl": "http://localhost:8001/preview/:contentType/:id"
}
```

`:contentType` - will be replaced with contentType `:id` - will be replaced with
id of contentType record

## Component model configuration

Component by default is neither previewable and cloneable . To enable You can
configure it by setting `previewable` or `cloneable` to true in a configuration
json file (`*.settings.json`):

For example for component called `paragraph_component` You need to change
`components/text/paragraph_component.json` by modifying option object:

```diff
{
  "collectionName": "components_text_paragraph_components",
  "info": {
    "name": "paragraph_component",
    "icon": "align-justify"
  },
  "options": {
+    "previewable": true,
+    "cloneable": true
  },
  "attributes": {
    "body": {
      "type": "text"
    }
  }
}
```

Previewing and Cloning could be mixed, or you can just set one of them.

## Usage

- Clone - Go to entry and click Clone (it will add new entry and set relation to
  original entry "cloneOf")
- Preview - Go to entry and click Preview (it will redirect to URI provided in
  custom.js configuration with injected contentType and id)
- Publish - if entry has `cloneOf` relation, than You will be able to replace
  original entry with your modified one by clicking "publish" and confirmation
  in modal
